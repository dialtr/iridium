  Completed work on the the **bootstrap** script. It successfully pulls
  down the necessary source and buildson Ubuntu 18.04. There are still
  some build errors to track down that don't appear to affect the
  ability to build/install binutils and the gcc cross compiler. The
  script is not really that robust at this time.
